An exploratory implementation of bit overloads of the C++ standard algorithms

## Description
While [The Bit Library](https://github.com/vreverdy/bit) is currently being proposed and reviewed by the ISO C++ Standards Committee, this repository is intended for exploratory developments on bit manipulation algorithm overloads based on the bit library. Once finalized, the algorithms will be merged to the main bit library repository and proposed for standardization to C++.

Overloading all of the routines in [<algorithm>] for bit iterators is an immense task. We aim to focus on the routines which (1) would benefit most from bit-parallel computation and (2) are commonly used in a bitwise setting. That being said, there are those out there who would benefit from an implementation of `sort` or `partition` which partitions all of the bits. Please open an issue if there is an routine in the <algorithm> header that you would like implemented in our library. Additionally, it may be useful to create a separate set of routines not present in <algorithm> that would be useful to the community. If you feel there is a popular bitwise algorithm on containers which cannot be efficiently implemented using the bit overloads for the <algorithm> library, please open an issue to let us know.

## Performance Benchmarks
We used Google's [benchmark](https://github.com/google/benchmark) library for computing benchmarks. Each benchmark is formatted as `{bit, std}::function` (size) [(alignment-tags)].

* `bit` is for this library, `std` is the standard library operating on the infamous `vector<bool>`. 
* (size) denotes the size of the container in bits. `small = 1 << 4`, `large = 1 << 16`
* (alignment-tags) refers to the memory alignment of the bit-iterators. `U` means the iterator does not fall on a word boundary, `R` means the iterator is placed at random, and `A` means the iterator is aligned with a word boundary.

For example, `bit::rotate (large) (ARA)` refers to our library's implementation of the `rotate` algorithm operating on a container of 32768 bits, where `first` and `last` are aligned but `n_first` is selected at random.
